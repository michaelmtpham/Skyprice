          <p>
            Skyprice is a Skyblock companion app meant to enhance your experience and
            take many boring tasks off your hand. In my experience playing Skyblock,
            many of these tasks weren't particularly interesting, which is my primary
            motivation for creating this. I hope that it benefits you as much as it
            benefits me!
