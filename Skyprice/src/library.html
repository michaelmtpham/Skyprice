                    This is the first real project that I have ever made. Initially, I struggled with
                    project ideas. Everyone said to create a project to solve a "problem" or make
                    a project that incorporated AI so you could fluff up your resume. However,
                    I found that the most meaningful advice came in the fact to make something
                    that was actually interesting. I was in a big Skyblock phase, so naturally I chose
                    to make my app using Skyblock as the primary focus. Surprisingly, there is lots to do!
